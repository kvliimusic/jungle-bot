# Version 1.0
Although this definitely isn't the first version, this is the first version published to github.

Here's a brief overview of what's changed since the last update:

1) **Jungle Jam command revamped**
  
  -- The three commands `/jamsubmit`, `/jamdate` and `/junglejam` have been combined into just `/junglejam`.
  
  -- The command shows the date of the next jungle jam, and the link to submit
  
  -- The submission link shows the day before the jungle jam as a deadline (the friday before)
  
  -- The submission link changes to a twitch link to watch on the day of the jungle jam.

  This covers the functions of the 3 commands before, and it makes them a lot less confusing!

2) Added these pages

3) Added a changelog command

4) Uploaded to github for anyone to see!
