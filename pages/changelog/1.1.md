# Version 1.1

Here's a brief overview of what's changed since the last update:

1) Merged `/challenge` and `/submitchallenge` commands into `/challenge`

2) Backend and github stuff that isn't exiting (most of which is in the gitignore file, so you won't see)

3) fixed statuses, and added a temporary command to switch to the jungle jam one
