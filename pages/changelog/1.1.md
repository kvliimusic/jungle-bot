# Version 1.0
Although this definitely isn't the first version, this is the first version published to github.

Here's a brief overview of what's changed since the last update:

1) Merged `/challenge` and `/submitchallenge` commands into `/challenge`

2) Backend and github stuff that isn't exiting (most of which is in the gitignore file, so you won't see)
